        <strong>Let's talk coffee.</strong> I am going to explain how to pull a shot of espresso. Normally when you pull shots you can pull two at a time, which is what we are going to do. If you are using coffee grounds, put the grounds in the portafilter and flatten them. Then take the portafilter and put it into the slot in your coffee machine. Make sure you tighten it but not too tight. Press the button for two shots and make sure to put a glass underneith it. Now you have your shots of espresso! YAY!

        <strong>Who doesn't love vanilla?</strong> I am going to tell you how to make a great vanilla latte. You will first have to pull two shots of espresso which is explained in the first dropdown. After you have done that grab the glass you want to use and put three pumps of vanilla into it. You can get vanilla syrup from anywhere, I got mine from target. Then choose whatever milk you like. I use oat milk and you are going to fill the glass almost half way with whatever milk you chose. Then you will take the shots of espresso and pour it on top. To make it sweeter I normally add honey, which is delicious! Make sure to stir and ENJOY!

        <strong>Hot lattes are a must.</strong> Although, it is different than making an iced one. First pull your shots of espresso. Once you have done that, grab a glass and add four pumps of mocha sauce. I use mocha sauce by ghirardelli. After that you are going to have to steam your milk! This can be a little more complicated but it's easy once you get the hang of it. Grab your milk of choice and pour it into a milk frothing pitcher. Put the pitcher underneath the steamer. Make sure the steamer is half way in the milk and tip the pitcher backwards toward yourself. Turn the steamer on and froth the milk until the pitcher becomes hot. Once hot, turn the steamer off. In the pitcher you will probably see some bubbles. To get rid of the bubbles, tap the pitcher on the counter a few times. After that, pour the espresso over the mocha sauce and stir. Now take the pitcher of milk and pour it in the glass in a cirlce. Make sure to pour close to the mug to have a little foam on top. Now you have a great hot mocha latte.

        <strong>Lavender is my favorite, especially in coffee!</strong> Let's teach you how to make my favorite coffee. Pull your shots of coffee like how it was explained above. Get your glass and put two pumps of lavender and one pump of vanilla. Lavender is strong so you don't put as much in. I add vanilla to make the flavor balanced. Then add your choice of milk and fill it halfway up the glass. Last, add your shots of espresso and stir. It tastes fresh and is a great spring coffee option!
